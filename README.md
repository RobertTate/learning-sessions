# ðŸ¤” Learning Sessions

Learning sessions create physical accountability between developers to help them pursue structured learning. Inspired by Seth Godin's [Paid to learn](https://seths.blog/2019/07/paid-to-learn/) blog post:

> ...employees are beginning to understand that the time and effort they put into continuing education comes back to them for the rest of their careers, because once you learn it, itâ€™s something you can use again and again.

## Liturgy

1. Everyone should tell the group what he/she is going to learn (update README)
2. Learn stuff
4. Briefly discuss what you learned
3. Schedule the next session

## Principles

- Specific accountablility - developers should have an actual learning source (e.g. course, podcast, code challenge, book, etc.) they are working through. "I'm thinking deep thoughts" is not an acceptable answer.
- Extremely limited talking/interacting (we take this seriously)
- Physical accountability is the goal, not socializing
- One hour a week
