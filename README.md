# ðŸ¤” Learning Sessions

Learning sessions create physical accountability between developers to help them pursue structured learning. Inspired by Seth Godin's [Paid to learn](https://seths.blog/2019/07/paid-to-learn/) blog post:

> ...employees are beginning to understand that the time and effort they put into continuing education comes back to them for the rest of their careers, because once you learn it, itâ€™s something you can use again and again.

2. Learn
3. Discuss what you learned

## Principles

### Curation

"Don't reinvent the wheel". There are already plenty of great courses and learning resources available. Let's simply find the best ones and make them easily accessible.

### Consistency and Discipline

We bring people together consistently (once a week for an hour) to reinforce disciplined learning.

### Accountability

Physically being in a room with other developers forces a focus that you cannot manufacture using willpower.

### Focus

This is not a social club full of mindless chitchat. We're focused on learning from experts and seasoned professionals. If you want to talk, save it for ðŸŒ® Taco Tuesday (or whatever social gathering you prefer).

### Professionalism

We use actual professional learning resources (courses, books, podcasts, articles, code challenges, etc.). "I'm thinking deep thoughts" is not an acceptable answer.

## Resources
